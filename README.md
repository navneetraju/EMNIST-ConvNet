# EMNIST-ConvNet
A very simple convolutional neural network for English alphabet recognition using the Keras Framework


Using the keras framework a basic CNN model was created.This project helps in understanding how to implement a simple CNN using the keras framework.
After you are done you can write a letter on a piece of paper upload it and it the model will recongize your handwritting!

All the preprocessing steps such as normalization and conversion to grayscale and resizing have been mentioned in the code(For your own image).
